## Digital Data

Participants were requested to capture and upload to a web platform images of all food and drink consumed during the two-week **digital data collection**. As a result, more than 9k food images are stored and available in the following [link](http://atvs.ii.uam.es/atvs/AI4FOOD/). The data is stored in the 'Food Images' folder. Within this folder, there is a sub-folder containing all the images labeled as 'XXXX_YYYY.jpg', where 'XXXX' is the User ID and 'YYYY' is the image number. Additionally, for each participant, there is an associated CSV file named 'XXXX_Food Images.csv', where 'XXXX' is the User ID. The CSV file provides information about the precise moment when each photo was taken, as indicated by the 'Timestamp' column. However, this information is only accurate if the 'Original Timestamp Validity' variable is set to True. If it is not, the timestamp represents the moment when the user uploaded the photo to the platform, which may not be the same as the time when the food was consumed.
